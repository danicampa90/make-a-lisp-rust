# Yet another fork of the make-a-lisp exercise
Forked from: (https://github.com/kanaka/mal/) - see the instructions there! 

The original rust code is trying to stay very close to the steps in the guide, often sacrificing readibility and "good" software architecture.
Here I'm playing with creating my own interpreter and I'm only loosely following the original guide.
You can find the various steps in the git history (not as separate files, as in the original repo).
